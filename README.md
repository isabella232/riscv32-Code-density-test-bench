# RISCV - 32 Test benches

This repo contain WD test benches which created upon observation and anaylasis of risc-v compilers, gcc and llvm, against diffrent ISA's.
Those test cases promoting issues were the compiler could do better in density aspects. 

Note: the first observation and anaylasis was based on gcc 7.x and few of the test cases have already been modified/fixed
